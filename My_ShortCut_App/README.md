This is my first Android App created with MIT App Inventor 2.
It is an App of a keyboard shortcuts list. You can create one list with the shortcuts, command names and descriptions for your favorite software. The data is storaged into your devise. 
You must install the ShortCut_App.apk file in your mobile Android to use My ShortCut App.
The ShortCut_App.aia file is the source code from App Inventor2. You can import it in your App Inventor account to see the code blocks and make modifications.
